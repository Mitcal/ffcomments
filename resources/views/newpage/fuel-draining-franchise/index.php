		<h3>Franchise</h3>
		<p>I have had alot of people asking about setting up in the fuel draining business and there are now 4 companies that I know of that are selling franchises, 1 of them is even trying to sell franchises in Australia.</p>
		<p>Firstly whats involved?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A drivers license, some common sense and about 30k should do the trick.</li>
			<li>You will have to have a good understanding of things mechanical, knowledge of fluid dynamics, understand car electrics and the fundamentals of electronics, have a good understanding of how to deal with petrol, diesel and the dangers of the job.</li>
			<li>You need to also have somewhere to store your fuel, a way of disposing it, and a van correctly kitted out.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is not a career decision to be made lightly and there are a few franchise buyers that I have spoken to for whom it did not turn out as expected or promised.</p>
		<p>Others canâ€™t handle the hours, or pressure.</p>
		<p>The AA, RAC, and now about 60 independent operators are now doing fuel drains in the UK as well as about 100 informal operators.</p>
		<p>If you are thinking of buying a franchise here is whats on offer, and a little of what I know.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Doctor Fuel</li>
			<li>Fuel Doctor</li>
			<li>Forecourt Assist</li>
			<li>FuelFix</li>
			<li>and a couple of others who only take franchisees by invitation.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I am happy to share my thoughts with anyone who is looking to get into this business, please leave me a comment (please state if you would not like your comments to be added to this page) I will be happy to answer your questions.</p>
		<p>Take care.</p>
