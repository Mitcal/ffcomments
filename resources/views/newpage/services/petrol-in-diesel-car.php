		<h4>What To Do When You Fill Your Petrol Car With Diesel?</h4>
		<p>If you happen to notice any of the symptoms mentioned earlier, you need to refrain from driving and stop your car in a safe spot. This will help in preventing your engines from extensive damage. Next, remove the keys from the ignition.</p>
		<p>In case your petrol tank is filled with less than two litres of diesel, you can simply fill the tank with petrol and your car should be fine. However, if it’s more than five litres, you need to refrain from driving. If you’re still at the station, you need to inform the staff about the situation, get someone to push your vehicle to a safe spot.</p>
		<p>You’ll then have to call a fuel removal service to drain your car’s fuel tank, flush the engines, and help you get back on the road as quickly as possible.</p>
		<h4>Potential Damage Of Filling Diesel In A Petrol Car</h4>
		<img src="{{ asset('uploads/wrong-fuel-in-car.jpeg') }}" alt="Petrol in Diesel" width="100%" style="padding:10px 0px;" />
		<p>What will happen if you fill your petrol car with diesel? Diesel is quite thicker and oily as compared to petrol. That said, you’d be relieved to learn that filing your petrol car with diesel doesn’t usually cause much serious damage to your vehicle.</p>
		<p>Diesel is compressed to be ignited, however, petrol can ignite with a single spark from the car’s spark plugs. As such, the first thing that gets damaged is the vehicle’s fuel filter. It’ll clog up quickly, while will then make your car halt and stall.</p>
		<p>Next, your spark plugs will get affected, which will cause your car to lose power, emit lots of smoke before it stops running completely. Once you’ve removed the wrong fuel from the system, your car or bike starts running quickly. You may notice some smoke initially as the diesel residue gets burned off. Once it passes, your vehicle will start running as before.</p>
		<p>Here are a few signs to look out for to determine if you’ve filled your petrol car tank with diesel:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Smoky exhaust while driving</li>
			<li>Engine cuts out</li>
			<li>Engine won’t start</li>
			<li>Engine misfiring</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Ways To Prevent Misfuelling</h4>

		<p>The following steps can help you in preventing any incorrect fueling mishaps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you’ve bought a new car with a new engine, leave reminders or prompts in the vehicle to minimize the likelihood of misfuelling.</li>

		</ul>
